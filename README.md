# Dementia Risk Prediction Project (Team Adagard)

This repository contains the code and final report for a machine learning project to predict dementia risk based on non-medical, self-reported data. The project emphasizes rigorous data cleaning, feature engineering, and a comprehensive model tournament to identify the most robust predictive model.

## 🚀 How to Review This Project

This project includes a detailed report and a fully pre-run notebook. For a complete overview of our process, findings, and analysis, please start with the report:

* **📄 `Adagard_report.pdf`**: A comprehensive PDF report detailing our data exploration, feature engineering, model tournament, and final explainability insights.
* **📓 `Adagard_experiments_notebook.ipynb`**: The complete Python notebook. **This file includes all code and pre-run outputs** from our experiments, including all EDA plots and the final model leaderboard.

> **Note for Judges:** The full model tournament (Cells 13, 14, and 15) is computationally expensive and may fail on standard hardware due to RAM limitations. For your convenience, all cells have been pre-run, and their outputs (results tables, figures, and analyses) are saved directly in the notebook and summarized in the PDF report
